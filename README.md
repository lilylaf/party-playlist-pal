Jaminals

​
## Imagine you're at the worst party- it's one where you wish anything would come and take you away from it because it's so... boring? 
​
## Well you've just been missing the Jaminals application! With Jaminals, a guest, host and DJ can collaborate to build a dope playlist. 
​
## One of the best parts? As a guest, you don't need to be logged in to participate. You don't have to sign up for **another** username/password. You can just go to the website and join the party!
​

​
​
### The events are listed but you can also search for one. 
​

​
​
### As the guest, once you're on the event page, feel free to add songs from the DJ's library to the party playlist. 
​

​
​
### Not everything can be done as an unauthenticated user- if you want to host, you've gotta sign up as a Host. Make sure you check whether you're a DJ or a Host when signing up! 
​
​
### You've decided to host an event, so you need to call up your DJ. The DJ now steps in to create your event:

​
​
### As the DJ, your home is unique to you. It shows your events that you're participating in and your song library. Here you can create the most insane rager in history, or a lowkey book club that needs ambient music.

​
### Alright, you and your host have decided to throw a party for their cat! Let's all head over to the Cat Jam. 
​

​
​
### We've got you covered! Some hosts need a night to think on their rules and information about their soirée. Luckily both the DJ **and** the Host can edit the event.
​
### Now that the DJ has created the event, the Host needs to take control of things. Once they log in and go to their tailored Host homepage, their new event that they've been added to should be there:

​
​
### Now with a new event- the Cat Jam! 
​
### But our Cat Jam playlist is a little... empty.

​
​
### Oh no! A party without tunes? Thankfully our Host is here to our rescue. The host selects the genre(s) for the party and that pulls the songs from the DJ's library that matches that genre. 
​

​
​
### Here the host is adding a genre.

​
​
### Look at that glorious playlist that just autopopulated based on genre.
​
### You don't even have to have a login to add songs to the event playlist. If you are a partier at the event, simply click the songs in the DJ playlist that you'd like to add! 
​
### Now everyone has collaborated and made this party the best party ever!
​
### Speaking of working together- if you're wondering who built this incredible application, we also have an about page:
